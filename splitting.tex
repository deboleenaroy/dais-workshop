\section{Conditional Deep Neural Networks}
\label{sec:conditional}
Explain the conditional, pointing to the existing work. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.08971.pdf

Identify any issues/drawbacks with this approach. How much information/confidence can be derived?
Will interpretability be an issue and how much extra information be gathered from the task being
partially completed?
