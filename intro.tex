Problem: Federated setting, different parties exist and different resources available with constraints
on these resources. How to split a neural network to address these resource constraints?

Challenge in a federated setting and edge is that the edge has limited resources. For example, party A
may provide access to party B for only limited amount of resources to ensure that its clients' needs are met.
Neural networks have become quite prevelant, however are resource intensive. One way to improve the resource
consumption is to reduce the footprint of the neural network (e.g., TFLite). This does not always solve the
problem as depending on the resource availability, the network may not get executed at all. 

We examine the problem of scoring neural networks in a federated setting with resource constraints.
Idea: Splitting of the neural network layers across multiple nodes. Evaluate the initial part in party A and then
use the output with confidence metric to determine partial information on the task at hand. This is
based on the resource consumption for the portion of the task. Then, depending on the need and availability of 
resources, move to the next portion of the computation on a different node (possibly in one's own party, when it becomes
available). More details of this will be in scenario section (TODO: Richard).

The splitting and conditional evaluation is explained in Splitting section (TODO: Kaushik)

Can this be extended to using Spiking (TODO: Kaushik)
